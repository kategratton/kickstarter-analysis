# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This analysis is to help uncover and identify trends in various kickstarter campaigns. This includes trends based on country, catergories, and success/failed/canceled campaign states. 

## My Findings
* Successful US kickstarters campaigns averaged a goal of $5,048.88, and Failed US Kickstarter campaigns averaged a higher goal of $10,554.21. 
* The best month to launch a Kickstarter program with the highest successful rate is May, including in the Theater Category.

Due to my findings, I would recommend starting a kickstarter in the Month of May, with an ideal goal between $2,000.00 - $4,059.62, as those statistics show the highest campaign success rate.
